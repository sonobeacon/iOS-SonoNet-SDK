# iOS-SonoNet-SDK

iOS 10 minimum required!

How to use:

Create a new iOS Xcode project or open an existing project. Now simply drag the sonolib.framework into your project navigator on the left hand side, possibly onto the Framework group, but thats entirely up to you.

Make sure that the ‚Add to targets‘ checkbox is checked for the correct target you intend to use the framework with. You can check Copy items into destination group’s folder if needed.
Add the framework to the Embedded Binaries in the General Project Settings.

In Build Settings, set „Enable Bitcode“ to No.
Also define in your Info.plist, why you will be using the microphone.

We will provide you with the SDK as well as the Api key and the Location Id.
